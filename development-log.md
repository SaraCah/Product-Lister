# First status update - 03/09/2019

I have started writing out a lot of code for an application where I want a user to input and what products they
have and be able to create a skin routine for it. However, after reading the assessment I have decided my original plan
was not sophistacted enough. However, I want to keep aspects of that idea by keep the fact that the user can input
what the product is, the product name and company and maybe create an organiser of some sort.
So i have taken a bit of a turn from my first idea but excited to try something maybe a bit more complicated.

I have a completely overhauled my project to make a organiser of some sort. I realise I have a problem with shopping 
and this will be a great way to minimise spending. A real issue I am facing is I don't get TDD and haven't implemented any gems
but apart from that, everything is going good.Hope to finish this by tonight.
